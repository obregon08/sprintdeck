# ADR-0001: Use Supabase for Authentication and Database

**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Technical Story:** [Link to authentication implementation story]

## Context

SprintDeck needs a robust authentication system and database solution. We need to choose between building a custom solution, using a managed service, or adopting an existing framework. The solution should be:
- Easy to implement and maintain
- Secure by default
- Scalable for future growth
- Cost-effective for a startup

## Decision

We will use Supabase as our primary authentication and database provider.

Supabase provides:
- Built-in authentication with multiple providers
- Real-time database capabilities
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- REST and GraphQL APIs
- TypeScript support
- Generous free tier

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with pre-built authentication flows
- Real-time capabilities out of the box
- Strong security features with RLS
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Active community and documentation
- Cost-effective for MVP and early growth

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to Supabase ecosystem
- Limited customization compared to custom solutions
- Potential scaling costs as usage grows
- Dependency on Supabase's uptime and performance

### Neutral
- Requires team to learn Supabase-specific patterns
- Database schema changes need to be managed through Supabase dashboard or migrations

## Alternatives Considered

- **Firebase:** Comprehensive but more complex pricing and Google ecosystem lock-in - Rejected due to cost concerns and preference for PostgreSQL
- **Custom Auth + PostgreSQL:** Maximum control but significant development overhead - Rejected due to time constraints and security considerations
- **Auth0 + Separate Database:** More flexible but increased complexity - Rejected due to additional integration complexity

## Implementation Notes

- Use Supabase Auth helpers for Next.js
- Implement Row Level Security policies for data protection
- Set up proper environment variables for different environments
- Consider implementing database migrations for schema changes
