# Request for Comments (RFCs)

This folder contains Request for Comments (RFCs) and technical design documents for SprintDeck.  
Use this space to propose, discuss, and document significant architectural or feature changes before implementation.  
Each RFC should be added as a separate markdown file and follow the project's RFC template.

## What is an RFC?

RFCs (Request for Comments) are documents that propose significant changes to the SprintDeck project. They serve as a way to:

- **Propose new features** or architectural changes
- **Gather feedback** from the team before implementation
- **Document design decisions** and their rationale
- **Ensure consensus** on major changes
- **Provide historical context** for future developers

## When to Create an RFC

Create an RFC when proposing changes that:
- Introduce new technologies or frameworks
- Significantly change the application architecture
- Add major new features or capabilities
- Modify core data models or APIs
- Change deployment or infrastructure approaches
- Introduce breaking changes to existing APIs

## RFC Process

### 1. Draft Phase
- Create an RFC using the template below
- Mark status as "Draft"
- Share with the team for initial feedback

### 2. Review Phase
- Address feedback and iterate on the proposal
- Mark status as "Review"
- Set a review deadline (typically 1-2 weeks)

### 3. Discussion Phase
- Team discusses the proposal
- Gather additional feedback and concerns
- Consider alternatives and trade-offs

### 4. Decision Phase
- Team votes on the proposal
- Mark status as "Accepted", "Rejected", or "Withdrawn"
- If accepted, create corresponding ADR for implementation

## RFC Template

Create each RFC as a new markdown file (e.g., `0001-real-time-collaboration.md`) and use the following format:

```markdown
# RFC-0001: [Short Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** [Draft | Review | Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn]  
**Author:** [Name of the RFC author]  
**Review Deadline:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Related Issues:** [Links to relevant issues]

## Summary

[One paragraph summary of the proposal]

## Motivation

[Why are we doing this? What problems does it solve? What is the expected outcome?]

## Detailed Design

[Detailed description of the proposed solution]

### User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

### Technical Implementation
[Describe the technical approach, APIs, data models, etc.]

### API Changes
[If applicable, describe any API changes]

### Database Changes
[If applicable, describe database schema changes]

### UI/UX Changes
[If applicable, describe interface changes]

## Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1:** [Description] - [Why rejected]
- **Alternative 2:** [Description] - [Why rejected]

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: [Description]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Phase 2: [Description]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
- [List potential risks]

### Mitigation Strategies
- [Describe how risks will be addressed]

## Success Metrics

[How will we measure the success of this proposal?]

## Open Questions

[Any unresolved questions or areas needing further discussion]

## References

- [Links to relevant documentation, research, or examples]
```

## RFC Numbering Convention

- Use sequential numbers starting from 0001
- Format: `RFC-0001`, `RFC-0002`, etc.
- File naming: `0001-short-title.md`

## Status Definitions

- **Draft:** Initial proposal, open for early feedback
- **Review:** Ready for team review and discussion
- **Accepted:** Proposal approved, ready for implementation
- **Rejected:** Proposal not approved
- **Withdrawn:** Author withdrew the proposal

## Review Guidelines

When reviewing RFCs, consider:

1. **Problem Definition**: Is the problem clearly defined?
2. **Solution Fit**: Does the proposed solution address the problem effectively?
3. **Technical Feasibility**: Is the solution technically achievable?
4. **Maintainability**: Will this be maintainable long-term?
5. **Performance**: What are the performance implications?
6. **Security**: Are there security considerations?
7. **User Experience**: How does this affect the user experience?
8. **Implementation Complexity**: Is the implementation plan realistic?

## Example RFC

See `0001-example-rfc.md` for a complete example of an RFC following this template.

## RFC vs ADR

- **RFCs** are for proposing changes before implementation
- **ADRs** are for documenting decisions that have been made
- RFCs often lead to ADRs once a decision is made

## Getting Help

If you need help with the RFC process:
- Review existing RFCs for examples
- Discuss your proposal with the team before drafting
- Use the RFC template to ensure completeness
- Set realistic review deadlines
