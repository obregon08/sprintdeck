# RFC-0001: Real-time Collaboration Features

**Date:** 2024-01-20  
**Status:** Review  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Review Deadline:** 2024-02-03  
**Related Issues:** #123, #124

## Summary

This RFC proposes adding real-time collaboration features to SprintDeck, including live editing, presence indicators, and conflict resolution. This will enable multiple users to work simultaneously on sprint planning and task management.

## Motivation

Currently, SprintDeck operates as a single-user application with basic CRUD operations. Users cannot collaborate in real-time, leading to:
- Manual coordination of sprint planning sessions
- Potential conflicts when multiple users edit simultaneously
- Lack of visibility into who is working on what
- Reduced team productivity during planning sessions

Real-time collaboration will improve team efficiency and make SprintDeck more competitive in the project management space.

## Detailed Design

### User Stories
- As a **sprint planner**, I want to see other team members' cursors and selections so that I can avoid conflicts and coordinate better
- As a **team member**, I want to see who is currently viewing the sprint board so that I know who to contact for questions
- As a **scrum master**, I want to see live updates as team members move tasks so that I can facilitate the planning session effectively
- As a **developer**, I want to edit task descriptions in real-time so that I can collaborate with my team without conflicts

### Technical Implementation

#### WebSocket Integration
- Use Supabase Realtime for WebSocket connections
- Implement presence tracking for user online status
- Handle connection state management and reconnection logic

#### Operational Transform (OT)
- Implement operational transform for conflict-free editing
- Use a library like ShareDB or implement custom OT logic
- Handle concurrent edits on the same document

#### UI Components
- Cursor indicators showing other users' positions
- Presence indicators in the user list
- Real-time activity feed
- Conflict resolution dialogs

### API Changes

#### New Endpoints
```
POST /api/collaboration/join-room
POST /api/collaboration/leave-room
GET /api/collaboration/presence
POST /api/collaboration/update-cursor
```

#### WebSocket Events
```typescript
interface CollaborationEvent {
  type: 'cursor_update' | 'presence_change' | 'document_edit';
  userId: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Database Changes

#### New Tables
```sql
-- Track user presence
CREATE TABLE user_presence (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  room_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_seen TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  cursor_position JSONB
);

-- Track document versions for OT
CREATE TABLE document_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  document_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  version INTEGER NOT NULL,
  operations JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### UI/UX Changes

#### New Components
- `CollaborationProvider`: Context provider for real-time state
- `UserPresence`: Shows who is currently online
- `CursorIndicator`: Shows other users' cursors
- `ActivityFeed`: Shows recent collaborative actions

#### UI Updates
- Add presence indicators to the sidebar
- Show cursor indicators on editable content
- Add collaboration status to the header
- Implement conflict resolution modals

## Alternatives Considered

- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Comprehensive but expensive and Google ecosystem lock-in - Rejected due to cost and existing Supabase investment
- **Custom WebSocket Server:** Maximum control but significant development overhead - Rejected due to maintenance burden
- **Polling-based Updates:** Simpler implementation but poor user experience - Rejected due to latency and server load concerns
- **Lock-based Editing:** Simple but limits collaboration - Rejected as it doesn't solve the core problem

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- [ ] Set up Supabase Realtime integration
- [ ] Implement basic presence tracking
- [ ] Create collaboration context and hooks
- [ ] Add user presence UI components

### Phase 2: Real-time Editing (3 weeks)
- [ ] Implement operational transform logic
- [ ] Add cursor tracking and indicators
- [ ] Create conflict resolution system
- [ ] Integrate with existing task editing

### Phase 3: Polish and Testing (2 weeks)
- [ ] Add activity feed
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Real-time features may slow down the application
- **Complexity**: OT implementation is complex and error-prone
- **Data Consistency**: Concurrent edits may cause data corruption
- **User Experience**: Poor UX during connection issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance**: Implement throttling and debouncing for frequent updates
- **Complexity**: Use battle-tested OT libraries and extensive testing
- **Data Consistency**: Implement robust conflict resolution and data validation
- **UX**: Graceful degradation when offline, clear connection status indicators

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: 50% increase in concurrent users during sprint planning
- **Performance**: <100ms latency for real-time updates
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for collaboration features
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ rating for collaboration features in user feedback

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement optimistic updates for better perceived performance?
2. How should we handle very large documents with many concurrent users?
3. What is the maximum number of concurrent users we should support?
4. Should we implement read-only mode for users with poor connections?
